# Project 2 - Memory Debugger

## Compilers  
- Cover which compilers your application targets
    - [ ] gcc [version]  
    - [ ] clang [version]  
    - [X] msvc/Visual Studio [2019]  
    

## Integration  
- Copy the source files into the project and ensure they are compiled alongside the project.

## Requirements  
- memdbg_init() must be called before any memory is allocated by the progam.

## Output  
- No output file, but informative error messages will be logged to stdout and breakpoints will be hit if a debugger is attached.

## Additional Information
### Areas of difficulty:
VirtualAlloc is really difficult to debug and fails seemingly randomly.

### How many hours the project took you:
5-6
